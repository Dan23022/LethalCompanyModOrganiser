# LethalCompanyModOrganiser
Mod organiser for Lethal company

**Instructions**
1.Right click LethalCompany on steam > Properties > Installed Files > Browse
2. Navigate into BepInEx > Plugins
3. Copy the file path from the File Explorer address bar
4. Open Config.INI in notepad or any text editor and then paste the copied path in to the path variable - (example) path = G:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Lethal Company\BepInEx\plugins  
5. Save the Config file and now Run the LCMO EXE - The app is not codesigned so it is likely to trigger windows smart screen - Review the code or run the exe through Virus total if you want some clarity  

**Note**
Currently this only works for taking and adding plugins to the game that you have installed onto the system but this will be updated in the future.  so if you install a mod that updates the content folder for instance, then you can technically still disable it or enable it by using this mod organiser as typically the .dll located in the plugins folder will handle enabling it but this is being worked on at the moment.

**Known issues**
Profiles do not work
Download Mods through the app does not yet work (Code I have for this works, just not Implemented into this version)
